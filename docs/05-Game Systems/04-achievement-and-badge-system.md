# Achievement & Badge System

## Objective

The Achievement system is designed to provide users with an enhanced gaming experience by offering additional motivation and direction. Upon completing designated missions, users will earn Achievement Badges. These badges can serve as proof for future airdrops and unlock various additional benefits. (WIP)

## Achievements

New achievements will continue to be added in the future. Currently, achievements are divided into two main categories, each with specific completion criteria.

------

## Types

There are two types of Achievements:

### Foodie Level Achievements

Achievements can be obtained by leveling up your Foodie account through contributions. When a Foodie reaches a specified level, they will automatically receive an achievement and a title. These achievements are automatically equipped and cannot be unequipped. As you reach higher levels, you will automatically receive new achievements and replace old titles.

#### Empowerment

Achievements for your Foodie level are automatically granted when you reach the specified level. You can only hold one title at a time, and as you reach higher levels, it will be replaced with a higher-tier title.
Achievement badges will be displayed on the lower right corner of your avatar in the Fooday app. Level badges serve as a way to showcase your ongoing and long-term contributions on Fooday.

### Mission Achievements

Achievements are accomplished by completing a series of missions. The background color of an achievement badge represents its difficulty level, ranging from the easiest to the hardest (Gray to Rainbow).
After completing the designated missions, you can acquire mission achievement titles by manually completing the missions and collecting the rewards.

#### Empowerment

You can equip up to five mission achievement badges on your profile. These badges may provide additional benefits to your Foodie account in the future (WIP).
