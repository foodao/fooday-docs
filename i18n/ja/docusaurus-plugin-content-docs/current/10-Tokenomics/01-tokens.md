Fooday is not just a food community; its economic token system is at its core. Currently, Fooday has two essential tokens and an experience point system: Fudos, FOOD, and FUSD. These three play different roles on Fooday and have differences in their usage.

## Fudos

**Earning Experience Points through Contributions**

Fudos are the experience points on the Fooday platform. Foodies with Fooca cameras can earn a certain amount of Fudos by completing missions, creating spots, reviewing food, and reporting incorrect information, among other methods. 

The system will automatically calculate and convert the earned Fudos into FOOD. Please refer to the [Fodus to FOOD Multiplier](/foodie-level#fudos-to-food-multiplier) section on the [Foodie Level](/foodie-level) page.

In short, by accumulating Fudos through interactions and contributions, a Foodie's level will increase. The Foodie's level affects the conversion rate of Fudos to FOOD, with higher levels enjoying better exchange rates.

## FOOD

**Food Platform Token**

In Fooday, FOOD has real-world value and serves as a versatile token. Firstly, Foodies can use FOOD for upgrading, charging, and minting Fooca cameras, enhancing their gaming experience on the platform.

Furthermore, Foodies can withdraw the earned FOOD to the blockchain and convert it into other cryptocurrencies, providing users with greater flexibility and various value realization possibilities.

:::info
It's important to note that the price of FOOD is determined by the market, so there may be fluctuations in its value.
:::

One important point to note is that FOOD cannot be used to directly purchase Fooca cameras; you need to use a specific economic currency - FUSD.

## FUSD

**Currency Available for In-App Purchase**

![FUSD](../token_fusd.jpg)

FUSD is a type of economic currency that can be directly purchased within the Fooday App. Foodies can use FUSD to buy special items like Fooca cameras, chests, accessories, etc., but it cannot be used for charging or upgrading Fooca cameras.

Similarly to FOOD, Foodies can also freely withdraw FUSD to the blockchain. It's worth mentioning that after withdrawing FUSD, it will be converted back into stablecoins, meaning its value will not be affected by fluctuations.

In addition to in-app purchases, if you have USDC/USDC.e on the blockchain, you can choose to transfer them to Fooday, and the platform will automatically convert them into FUSD at a 1:1 ratio, allowing users to quickly start enjoying the food experience.
