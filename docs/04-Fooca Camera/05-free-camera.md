title: Free Fooca Camera
---

Even if you haven’t purchased a Fooca camera, you can still participate in the Fooday community with the Free Fooca Camera. Foodies with a free camera can earn Fudos and level up their foodie level status by creating spots and writing reviews, just like those who have bought a camera.

### Free Fooca Camera Limitations

Although the free camera allows you to earn Fudos and FOOD and level up foodie level, please note:

> **Users cannot withdraw the FOOD rewards they earn. You need to purchase a Fooca camera from the marketplace to unlock the withdrawal feature.**

For example, if you earn 1,000 FOOD with the free camera, you won’t be able to cash out until you buy a paid camera from the marketplace. After purchasing a camera from the marketplace, your free camera will disappear, and the withdrawal feature will be unlocked, allowing you to withdraw your 1,000 FOOD.
