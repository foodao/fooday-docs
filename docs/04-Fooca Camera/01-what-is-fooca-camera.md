title: What is Fooca Camera
---

The Fooca Camera is a unique NFT exclusive to Fooday, designed to enhance the Foodie experience within the community while simultaneously driving the platform's growth.

But what is the purpose of the Fooca Camera? The Fooca Camera serves as the entry ticket to Fooday's culinary community, essential for foodies looking to earn rewards while indulging in the world of food. 

:::info
In simple terms, without a Fooca Camera, foodies won't be able to kickstart their journey to earning rewards.
:::

The Fooca Camera NFT is not just your typical NFT; it comes with levels, battery, and four distinct attributes: compute, quality, battery, and foospirit. 

Each attribute affects the performance efficiency of the Fooca Camera, and the number of Fooca Cameras a foodie possesses determines their account's energy value on the platform.

#### A Guarantee for the Culinary Community

Furthermore, the Fooca Camera also acts as collateral for the Fooday platform. In cases where a foodie repeatedly posts malicious reviews or violates community guidelines, Fooday may confiscate their cameras as a penalty, ensuring the peace and fairness of the community.

```
10 (Base Energy) + 2 (Advanced Camera Bonus) = 12.
```

### Fooca ID

The Fooca ID is used to distinguish each Fooca Camera / Fooca Box, representing a unique identifier for each Fooca, ensuring there are no duplicate Fooca ID.

Fooca Cameras numbered from #1 to #499 are test cameras used during the trial period and has been burnt and destroyed upon the official launch.

The first batch of Fooca Camera are minted with the ID starting from #500 after the official release. With each Fooca Box minted, the number increments by 1, ordered chronologically by minted time. Both regular Fooca Cameras and Genesis Fooca Cameras follow the same numbering system. The Fooca Box's number corresponds to the Fooca Camera obtained when it is opened.

For example, the Fooca Camera obtained from opening the #500 Fooca Box will also have the camera ID #500.

> The Fooca Camera ID is not equivalent to the NFT token ID assigned to the camera upon minting. Currently, Fooca Cameras and Fooca Boxes do not support on-chain transaction.
