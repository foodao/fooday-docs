Energy is an essential element for Foodies when making contributions. Each contribution requires a varying amount of energy. You can check your current energy amount at the bottom of the page on the Fooday App.

Only with a Fooca Camera can you possess Energy, which is required for community contributions.

## Fooca Camera Bonuses

### Camera Quantity Bonus

**The more Fooca Cameras you have, the more Energy your foodie account possesses**, allowing for more contributions within a day.


Here's the relationship between the number of cameras and Max Energy:

| Fooca camera  | Max Energy  | 
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 Camera | 6 Energy |
| 3 Cameras | 10 Energy  | 
| 9 Cameras | 18 Energy  | 
| 15 Cameras | 30 Energy  | 

### Advanced Camera Bonus

Owning an Advanced Fooca Camera provides a direct bonus to your Foodie Energy. Each Advanced Fooca Camera increases your maximum Foodie Energy by +1. The bonus is cumulative, meaning that having X Advanced Fooca Cameras adds X to your maximum Foodie Energy.

Classic Fooca Cameras do not provide an additional Foodie Energy bonus.

 

#### For example:

If you have 3 cameras, including 2 Advanced Fooca Cameras, your maximum Foodie Energy would be 

```
10 (Base Energy) + 2 (Advanced Camera Bonus) = 12.
```

## Energy Consumption

Most contributions require energy consumption, and different types of contributions have varying basic energy consumption levels. Please refer to the following table:

| Contributions  | Energy Cosumption    | Battery Cosumption     | *Max Fudos    |
|:---:        | :---:        |:---:       | :---:       |
| Review      | 4 Energy  | 10% Battery  | 45 Fudos    |
| Create Spot | 3 Energy  | 5% Battery   | 15 Fudos   |
| Update Spot | 1 Energy  | 2% Battery   | 3 Fudos    |
| Report      | 1 Energy  | 2% Battery   | **Original Fudos value of Review/Spot     |

## Energy Recovery

Once energy is consumed, it can only be restored over time, and **regardless of how much energy you have, it will fully replenish within a day.**

#### For example:

* If you have 1 Camera with a total energy of 6, it will take 4 hours to recover 1 energy.
* If you have 3 Cameras with a total energy of 10, it will take 2.4 hours to recover 1 energy, and so on.



:::Note
Energy accumulates in your Foodie account, not on individual Fooca Cameras.
