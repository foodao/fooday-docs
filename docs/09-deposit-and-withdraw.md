## How to fund your Fooday account?
To purchase a Fooca Camera in the marketplace, you can either buy FUSD within the Fooday app or transfer USDC to your Fooday wallet.

Let‚Äôs walk through how to deposit funds on Fooday if you‚Äôre not familiar with blockchain and online transactions.

***

### Method 1: In-App Purchase of FUSD on Fooday
If you‚Äôre new to blockchain and transactions, buying FUSD within the Fooday app is the quickest way to go.

It‚Äôs quite simple. Start by tapping the rightmost option in the menu atra the bottom. Find ‚ÄúPurchase FUSD,‚Äù choose the amount you want to buy, and FUSD will automatically be stored in your Fooday wallet, similar to how in-app purchases work in other mobile games.

### Method 2: Transferring USDC to Your Fooday Wallet

1. Currently, Fooday only supports the Polygon chain.  


USDC contract addressÔºö[`0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359`](<https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359>)  
USDC.e contract addressÔºö[`0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174`](<https://polygonscan.com/address/0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174>)

<br/>

The second method involves transferring USDC from your crypto wallet to your Fooday wallet. We‚Äôll use the example of the [Rabby](<https://rabby.io/>) wallet, but you can use other wallets or exchanges like Binance as well.


<br/>

#### Steps
1. Again, tap the rightmost option in the menu at the bottom and select ‚ÄúFUSD‚Äù under Wallet. On the following page, click ‚ÄúDeposit‚Äù (currently supporting the Polygon chain only; the system will fill it in automatically).

2. Next, press the ‚ÄúDeposit‚Äù button at the bottom, and you will be redirected to your FUSD transfer address as shown in the image.

3. Copy the address and return to your Rabby wallet. Click ‚ÄúSEND,‚Äù select the Polygon chain, and paste the Fooday wallet address you copied earlier. Enter the amount of USDC you want to deposit (FUSD:USDC = 1:1), and hit ‚ÄúSend.‚Äù

4. Your FUSD will appear in your Fooday wallet! However, please note that there may be a waiting period after depositing funds before you can use them. You can check the status by clicking on ‚ÄúFUSD.‚Äù Once it shows as confirmed, you can start using it!

5. Use FUSD to purchase a camera in the marketplace and kickstart your journey of eating while earning!

üì£ **Reminder: Be sure to select the Polygon chain; currently, Fooday only supports Polygon.**

### On-Chain Gas Fee
Transactions on the blockchain incur a Gas Fee, which is the native cryptocurrency of that blockchain. **For Polygon, the native cryptocurrency is Matic.**

After withdrawing FOOD / FUSD and before converting your wallet‚Äôs FOOD / FUSD into USDC, you will need to pay the Gas Fee on the Polygon chain.

This means you need to have some Matic available.

#### Transferring Matic to your web3 wallet
üìå If you do not have Matic:

Please refer to the deposit tutorial article. The process to withdraw USDC from Binance Exchange to Fooday is the same, but you need to change the address to your web3 wallet (Rabby) for your Fooday wallet.

Once you have Matic in your wallet, you can smoothly convert FOOD / FUSD into USDC!

>The Gas Fee on the Polygon chain is quite reasonable, typically only around $0.01 per transaction if you‚Äôre not in peak periods. Fooday recommends that you don‚Äôt need to exchange too much; 5 Matic should last you a long time.
