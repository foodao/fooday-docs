In Fooday, foodies with Fooca Cameras can earn Fudos by contributing, and their levels will also increase.

**Currently, the highest level for Foodies is open up to level 50.**The formula for the Fudos accumulated required to level up is as follows:

```
Required Fudos to level up = Rounded {[（0.7 * Target level ^ 0.78）- 0.15] * 55}
```

Fudos serve as experience points on the Fooday platform. Foodies with Fooca Cameras can earn a certain amount of Fudos by completing tasks, creating spot locations, sharing culinary experiences, and reporting incorrect information.

## Fudos to FOOD Multiplier

The Fudos earned by a foodie on a given day will automatically convert to FOOD after 24 hours on the next day at 00:00 UTC, without any manual action needed.

```
In the absence of any bonuses, the conversion rate of Fudos to FOOD is 1:1
```
 

Example: 

On March 1st, if John accumulates 100 Fudos throughout the day, the system will convert his accumulated Fudos to 100 FOOD on March 3rd at 00:00 UTC.

However, the conversion rate is affected by the foodie's level. The settled FOOD multiplier formula is:

```
Multiplier = 1 + (Foodie level - 1)/100
```

For instance, at the current **Foodie level of 6**, the conversion rate will be multiplied by **1.05**, meaning that John can get **105 FOOD**.

:::tip
Advantage of Higher foodie Levels: The higher the foodie's level, the better the exchange rate of Fudos to FOOD.
