If you own a Fooca Camera, engaging in community contributions is the fastest way to earn Fudos. Below, we'll explain the limits and Fudos rewards for each contribution action.
 
### 🏠 Create Spot

When creating a spot, you don't need to be near the restaurant, and it's not mandatory to upload restaurant photos. However, the more detailed the information you provide about the establishment, the more Fudos you can earn.

### 📓 Review

While reviewing a spot, you don't need to be near the restaurant, but you must upload dining photos. Please note that photos cannot be uploaded from your local gallery; they must be selected from the Fooday album. This signifies that you've dined on-site and used the Fooca Camera to capture the moment.

>Tip: We recommend foodies use the Fooca Camera to document their dining experiences. Even if you don't publish the review immediately, you can always add the review later with the dining photos!


### 👷 Update Spot

If there are changes in restaurant information such as operating hours or address, foodies can help update the spot and receive update rewards.

### 🚨 Report

If you come across any incorrect information, inappropriate content, or irrelevant details, you can choose to report the spot or review. Reports will enter a verification voting process, where Fooday will randomly select other foodies to participate in the vote. If the report is successful, you will receive the Fudos the reported foodie earned from the spot or review.
