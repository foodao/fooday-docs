# Referral System

Fooday has implemented a referral system to encourage its users to invite friends to join Fooday and become Foodies by purchasing the Fooca Camera, allowing users to earn additional rewards.

## Invitation code program

Within the Fooday app, users have the option to explore the platform without logging in. However, to gain full access and start Eat & Earn, users must enter an invitation code during the sign-up process.

### Rules

Each invitation code involves a two-step mission for its application:

**Mission 1: Invite a friend to join Fooday**

**Mission 2: The invited friend becomes a Foodie and contributes at least once**

* As you level up, you'll receive 1 extra invitation code.
* Each invitation code consists of a unique 7-digit combination of alphabets and numerals.
* Each invitation code is eligible for claiming the rewards of "Mission 1" and "Mission 2" once.
* Invitation codes can only be used once, so share wisely.
* You'll receive the 10x Reward for "Mission 2" only when your invited friends contribute once with a Fooca Camera.
* Fooday reserves the right to modify campaign features and specifications without prior notice.

### How to Obtain an Invitation Code to become a signed-up Foodie?

Some has to share their invitation code with you so that you can apply the invitation code to proceed your sign-up process. Follow the Fooday social media to get the latest available inviation code shared by other Foodies.
