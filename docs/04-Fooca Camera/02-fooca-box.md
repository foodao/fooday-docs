### Regular Camera Boxes
New camera boxes generated through minting will result in regular camera boxes. There are two types of regular camera boxes, as mentioned earlier: common camera boxes and rare camera boxes.

The difference between the two camera boxes lies in their unboxing probabilities. Please refer to the table below for the probabilities.
