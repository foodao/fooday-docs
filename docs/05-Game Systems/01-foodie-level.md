In Fooday, foodies with Fooca Cameras can earn Fudos by contributing, and their levels will also increase.

*** 

> Advantage of Higher foodie Levels: The higher the foodie's level, the better the exchange rate of Fudos to FOOD.

Fudos serve as experience points on the Fooday platform. Foodies with Fooca Cameras can earn a certain amount of Fudos by completing tasks, creating spot locations, sharing culinary experiences, and reporting incorrect information.

#### Foodie level benefit

The Fudos earned by a foodie on a given day will automatically convert to FOOD on the 8th day at 00:00 UTC, without any manual action needed. In the absence of any bonuses, the conversion rate of Fudos to FOOD is 1:1.
 

Example: On March 1st, if John accumulates 100 Fudos throughout the day, the system will convert his accumulated Fudos to 100 FOOD on March 8th at 00:00 UTC.

But if we calculate at the current Foodie level of 6, the conversion rate will be multiplied by 1.05, meaning that John can get 105 FOOD.
