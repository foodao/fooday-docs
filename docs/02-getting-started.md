#### 3. Acquire FUSD to Purchase Fooca Cameras
If you want to start earning while dining, you'll first need to acquire FUSD and use it to purchase Fooca cameras. Currently, in Fooday, there are two ways to obtain FUSD:

* Purchase FUSD within the Fooday app.
* Transfer USDC from the Polygon chain into your Fooday wallet, where it will automatically convert to FUSD (supported by Rabby wallet and exchanges).

#### 4. Purchase Fooca Cameras
Once you have FUSD, you can go to the camera marketplace and buy Fooca cameras and Fooca camera boxes. Afterward, you can start contributing and earning while enjoying your meals.

### Acquiring FUSD Method 1: In-App Purchase of FUSD
If you're not familiar with blockchain and on-chain transactions, using Fooday's in-app purchase of FUSD is the quickest way. 

The in-app purchase method is quite simple. First, click on the rightmost menu at the bottom, find "Purchase FUSD," and select the desired amount you wish to purchase. FUSD will then automatically be deposited into your Fooday wallet, similar to the in-game purchase methods used in other mobile apps.

### Acquiring FUSD Method 2: Transferring USDC to Your Fooday Wallet
The second method involves transferring USDC or USDC.e from your on-chain wallet into your Fooday wallet. Here's an example of how to do this using the Rabby wallet, but you can use other wallets or exchanges like Binance as well.

Please note:

* **Fooday currently supports the Polygon chain, and the system will automatically set this.**  

* **The withdrawal function is not available at the moment. You'll need to wait for at least one month after depositing before you can withdraw.**  

USDC Contract Address: `0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359`

USDC.e Contract Address: `0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174`

<br/>

#### Steps:
1. Again, tap the rightmost option in the menu at the bottom and select “FUSD” under Wallet. On the following page, click “Deposit” (currently supporting the Polygon chain only; the system will fill it in automatically).

2. Next, press the “Deposit” button at the bottom, and you will be redirected to your FUSD transfer address as shown in the image.

3. Copy the address and return to your Rabby wallet. Click “SEND,” select the Polygon chain, and paste the Fooday wallet address you copied earlier. Enter the amount of USDC you want to deposit (FUSD:USDC = 1:1), and hit “Send.”

4. Your FUSD will appear in your Fooday wallet! However, please note that there may be a waiting period after depositing funds before you can use them. You can check the status by clicking on “FUSD.” Once it shows as confirmed, you can start using it!

5. Use FUSD to purchase a camera in the marketplace and kickstart your journey of eating while earning!

>📣 Reminder: Be sure to select the Polygon chain; currently, Fooday only supports Polygon.
