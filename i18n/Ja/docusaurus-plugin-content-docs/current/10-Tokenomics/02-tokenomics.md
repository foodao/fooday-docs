## Explore Fooday's Tokenomics

Fooday’s tokenomics system is designed to incentivize Foodies to leave accurate and detailed reviews while promoting positive behavior within the community. Here’s how it works:

### Acquisition of a Fooca Camera

Before a Foodie can start earning rewards on Fooday, they must first acquire a Fooca Camera, which is a unique and personalized representation of their personality and engagement within the community. This serves as collateral to ensure good behavior, and any Foodie found to be in violation of the platform’s guidelines may have their Fooca Camera impacted, which could result in the loss of rewards or restrictions on their ability to use the platform. Fooca Camera is a type of NFT used exclusively within the Fooday ecosystem.

### Earning Fudos

Once a Foodie has acquired a Fooca Camera, they can start earning Fudos for their contributions to the platform, such as leaving reviews, adding new restaurants, or engaging with other Foodies. Fudos represent a credit point of a Foodie and the more Fudos a Foodie earns, the higher their level within the platform and the higher the bonus they receive when earning Food Coins. Fudos is not transferrable because you can’t buy the credit, you need to earn it, which further incentivizes Foodies to actively engage with the platform and contribute to the community.

### Receiving Food Coins

To receive Food Coins, foodies must accumulate Fudos during a set period, with the amount of Food Coins received determined by the number of Fudos accumulated. More Fudos result in a higher payout of Food Coins, which Foodies can use to level up or repair their Fooca Camera, mint new Fooca Camera, or acquire new equipment, incentivizing active engagement with the platform and community participation. The use of Food Coins within the system provides added incentives and a sense of ownership in the ecosystem.
